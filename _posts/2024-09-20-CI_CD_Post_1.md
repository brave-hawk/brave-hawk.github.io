Using the **Org Development Model** is my go-to strategy for managing Salesforce deployments. It’s straightforward and effective, particularly for setups requiring distinct development environments.

## Environment Setup

I’ve configured three Salesforce Developer Edition orgs to mimic typical environments in a CI/CD pipeline:


1. **LucidSF_Prod**: Simulates the **Production** environment, housing stable, verified code.
2. **LucidSF_Integration**: Acts as the **Integration** environment for merging and testing code.
3. **LucidSF_Develop**: The **Development** environment where new features and fixes are built and tested.

These orgs help ensure a smooth workflow from development to production.

## Version Control with GitHub

The project is managed through a GitHub repo, initialized from a clean org. Key components tracked include:

- **Apex Classes**: Server-side business logic.
- **Flows**: Declarative automations.
- **Flexipages**: Custom page layouts.
- **Objects**: Custom object schemas.
- **LWC Components**: Lightning Web Components for a better UI.

Version control in GitHub keeps our codebase organized and auditable.

## CI/CD Workflow

1. **Develop in LucidSF_Develop**: Changes are built and committed to GitHub.
2. **Test in LucidSF_Integration**: Merged code is tested to catch conflicts.
3. **Deploy to LucidSF_Prod**: Stable code is pushed to production.

### Collaborative Development Workflow

In the image I’ve shown, you can see a representation of how multiple developers (example, 3 developers) would collaborate within our CI/CD pipeline. Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. **Individual Development**: Each developer works on their own feature or bug fix. When ready, they create a **pull request (PR)** to share their changes with the team.
2. **Code Review**: The pull requests are reviewed by a tech lead or senior developer. This review process ensures code quality and adherence to best practices. Feedback is provided, and once the changes are approved, they are merged into the main branch.
3. **Integration Testing**: The merged code is then deployed to the **LucidSF_Integration** org. Here, thorough testing takes place to verify that new features integrate seamlessly with existing functionality.
4. **Deployment to Production**: If the code passes all integration tests, it is deemed stable and is pushed to the **LucidSF_Prod** org. This way, only thoroughly tested code reaches the production environment, ensuring reliability for end users.
